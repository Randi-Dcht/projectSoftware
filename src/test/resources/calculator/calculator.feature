Feature: Integer Arithmetic Expressions
  This feature provides a range of scenarios corresponding to the
  intended external behaviour of arithmetic expressions on integers.

  # This is just a comment.
  # You can start with a Background: that will be run before executing each scenario.

  Background:
    Given I initialise a calculator

  # Each scenario can be seen as a test that can be executed with JUnit,
  # provided that each of the steps (Given, When, And and Then) are
  # implemented in a Java mapping file (CalculatorSteps.Java)
