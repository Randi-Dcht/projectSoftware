/**
 * Problem :
 * ---------
 * It should be possible to represent and manipulate numbers in different
 * bases n (eg. , 2=binary, 8= octal, 16=hexadecimal, and so on...), and to
 * convert numbers between these different bases. Note that, in order to
 * support hexadecimal numbers (especially in combination with a GUI, one
 * also needs to be able to use the A to F characters in the number
 * representation. To be discussed whether and how we want to support other
 * bases above 10, and how to represent these numbers. We could easily go up
 * to 36 (since we have 26 letters in the alphabet on top of the 10 digits
 * from 0 to 9. I would not go higher than base 36, since in practice nobody
 * be using that
